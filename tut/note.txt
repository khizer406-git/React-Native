Recognizing funding by the PIF as a contribution to the project's work can be done through several means:

Acknowledgment in project documentation: Including a section in project reports, research papers, or presentations specifically acknowledging the PIF funding received is a common practice. This acknowledgment can highlight the PIF agency or program that provided the funding and express gratitude for their support.

Public recognition in project communications: Utilize various communication channels, such as project websites, social media platforms, newsletters, and press releases, to publicly recognize and acknowledge the PIF's contribution. This can be done by mentioning the PIF funding, sharing updates on the project's progress and impact, and expressing appreciation for the support received.

Co-branding opportunities: If permissible and in line with the PIF's policies, consider co-branding opportunities. This can involve displaying the PIF agency's logo alongside the project's logo in project materials, events, or publications, indicating the collaborative nature of the work.

Public events and showcases: Organize events or showcases to highlight the project's outcomes and invite PIF officials or representatives to attend as honored guests. During these events, publicly recognize the PIF's funding contribution, and provide a platform for them to speak about their support and the project's significance.

Media coverage: Leverage media outlets, both traditional and digital, to share the project's achievements and acknowledge the PIF funding. Seek opportunities for interviews, press releases, or articles that highlight the PIF's role in supporting the project and its impact on society.

Formal letters of appreciation: Prepare formal letters of appreciation addressed to the relevant PIF agency or department, expressing gratitude for their financial support and outlining the project's accomplishments resulting from their contribution. These letters can be sent directly to the appropriate contacts within the PIF organization.

It's important to adhere to any guidelines or regulations set forth by the PIF agency regarding acknowledgment and recognition of their funding contributions.
